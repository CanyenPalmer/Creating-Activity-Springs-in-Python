## Introduction 

Data professionals work with a lot of string data. For example, while analyzing the results of a marketing campaign, you may need to review item descriptions or customer names, which is stored as string data. Becoming comfortable working with strings in Python is essential for the work of a data professional.

In this lab, you'll practice coding in Python and working with strings. You'll work with a store ID, ZIP Code, and a custom URL for the store you're gathering data on.

## Conclusions
* Strings are instrumental in storing important data, such as unique identifiers.
* String concatenation helps you combine data that is stored in different strings.
* String formatting is useful when inserting specific values into reusable string templates.
* Functions boost efficiency by reusing code for repeated tasks.
